# django-heroku_deploy
This is a demo of a project involving a simple django app that's deployed to heroku.
created this as am learning thus some parts may not work as you expect and i may notbe able to answer some questions but hope this helps to start one off.

Helpful references that i used include:

The steps are as in the django_heroku.txt.
